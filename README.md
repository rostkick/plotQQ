# plotQQ
This is an upgraded function from the [GenABEL](https://github.com/GenABEL-Project/GenABEL) package [[1]](#1). The package was previously removed from CRAN and the function was saved to avoid a more complicated installation of the package from source. This function has been upgraded to my taste and now returns a ggplot2 object, which allows more plot customization.
